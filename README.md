I'm glad to welcome you to my profile page. At the moment, I have posted some of my first projects here. Unfortunately, most of my works were made for use in commercial projects, so I can't share their open source. Among my projects I can single out:
- web application for interacting with MySQL database;
- price tracking parser;
- add-on over Web Whatsapp wrapper;
- and other.

I mainly use PHP to work on projects. I'm learning new things, I will be happy to share my skills with you or to develop a joint project in the field of web application development.
