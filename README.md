# Hi üëã, I'm Alexey Kirichek!

### üë®üèª‚Äçüíª About Me
My name is Alexey, I'm a full stack web developer. In 2021, I completed my master's degree and have since been honing my skills, studying modern approaches to problem-solving, and actively developing in the field of web application development. During my studies, I uploaded my projects to public repositories and received a few stars and forks. I hope they were helpful to someone, though I have now hidden them as I consider them to be too unpolished. For the past few years, I have been living in different countries and participating in various commercial projects. My solo project activity is reflected below. My team project contributions are available on my GitLab page.

### üîß I have worked on tasks such as:
- implementing a Telegram bot for a courier service that simplifies the process of receiving and completing orders, tracks courier movements, calculates their daily routes, and computes salaries considering fuel expenses;
- developing a web application for a technical support service as an extension to existing software. This product automated the process of generating statistical reports, selective backup creation with customizable access to information, search, and other routine actions. The application included an admin panel with user and role management, user metrics collection, and much more;
- creating a WhatsApp bot for gathering feedback on service quality, used by dozens of companies to monitor customer satisfaction and enhance service quality;
- integration tasks between various systems, such as Jira and Telegram, Jira and Zabbix, 1C Bitrix and iiko, and others;
- Web Scrapers for data collection and analysis;
- and more.

I have experience developing with Laravel, 1C Bitrix, Yii2, Pimcore, Bitrix24, Vue.js, and Nuxt. I have built websites from scratch as well as fixed and upgraded existing ones. I have optimized websites according to tasks from SEO specialists and configured servers and environments for various projects.
